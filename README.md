## Description

- This is my first project in Python. I started learning Python for my career and basic knowledge of different programming language. In this snake game, I learn how to use imports, basic syntax structure, while loop, if conditions and basic programming paradigms. 
- This project contain two components:
	1) Snake
	2) Fruit
- Initally, you will see the snake size is small as fruit size. When snake start eating fruits snake size will be eventually increased. When snake touch the border, it will die instant.
